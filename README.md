# C Text Editor

**WIP**

A very simple text editor written in C. Mostly for learning purposes. It's not
going to be usable, ever...

At the moment you can open a file, but you can't edit it. It's just a file viewer...
Most things are a bit fucked, but I'm learning more and more C. So that's good...
